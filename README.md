# Python-Customer-Segmentation-Clustering
# Project Overview
This project aims to segment shopping customers based on their income, age, and mall shopping score. The primary goal is to provide valuable insights to the marketing team, allowing them to plan a targeted strategy for different customer segments.

# Problem Statement
Understanding the target customers is crucial for the marketing team to develop an effective strategy. The boss has identified income, age, and mall shopping score as key factors in determining customer segments. The specific objectives are:

Identify the most important shopping groups.
Determine the ideal number of groups and assign labels to each.
Provide insights through summary statistics and visualizations.
# Approach
   #  1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct a quick EDA to gain insights into the distribution and relationships of the key variables.
#  2.K-Means Clustering Algorithm:

Utilize the K-Means clustering algorithm to create distinct customer segments based on income, age, and shopping score.
#  3.Summary Statistics on Clusters:

Generate summary statistics for each cluster to understand the characteristics of each segment.
#  4.Visualization:

Create visualizations to present the clusters and their characteristics in an easily understandable format.
# Analysis
# Target Cluster:
The target group is identified as Cluster 1, characterized by a high spending score and high income.

Approximately 60% of Cluster 1 shoppers are women, indicating a potential focus on marketing campaigns targeting popular items in this cluster.

Cluster 2 represents an interesting opportunity to market sales events on popular items. Further optimization strategies should be explored for this cluster to maximize its potential.
